Spamd-utils
-----------

Note this is for OpenBSD spamd not spamasassin.

There are two utils here:

dnsbl-scan.py
-------------

Util that will run over spamd greylists, look up in DNSBL and blacklist
anything it finds there.  It maintains a cache so it doesn't need to
look stuff up every time.  Currently hard-coded to zen.spamhaus.org

You wil want a crontab entry like:

*/15    *       *       *       *       /usr/local/bin/dnsbl-scan.py

assuming a spamd whitelist time of >= 20 mins

spfupdate.sh
------------

Looks up SPF entries for domains and generates an IP list that can be used
as a table entry in pfctl
